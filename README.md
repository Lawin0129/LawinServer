##### * Included in the [LawinServer Addon](https://github.com/PRO100KatYT/LawinServerAddon). To install it, merge its `public` folder with the one in your LawinServer folder. [(Direct download link)](https://github.com/PRO100KatYT/LawinServerAddon/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

## How to host/use LawinServer
1) Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2) Run "install_packages.bat" (This file isn't required after the packages are installed.)
3) Run "start.bat", It should say "Started listening on port 3551"
4) Use something to redirect the fortnite servers to localhost:3551 (Which could be fiddler, ssl bypass that redirects servers, etc...)
